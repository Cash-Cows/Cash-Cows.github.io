  <h2>Memebot is Now Live</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>
    As requested by the community, we deployed an animated gif 
    memebot generator on our discord.
  </p>
  <p>
    A lot of tech was used to get this memebot live including,
    tensorflow for facial detection, blockchain for milk 
    processing, IPFS for file hosting, discord APIs, render.com 
    for bot hosting and many gif parsing and encoding libraries.
