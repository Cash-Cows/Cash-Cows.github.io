  <h2>Welcome to the Barn</h2>
  <hr />

  <p>
    This marks the next step in the journey of your Cash Cows. 
    The end of this part of the experiment will be a study on 
    how you prioritize intrinsic value over speculative. Let's 
    make this a good study.
  </p>

  <h3>What is the Barn?</h3>

  <p>The barn is where you can go to milk your cows.</p>

  <h3>What do I have to do to get $MILK?</h3>

  <p>
    No staking, just redeem when you want it in your wallet. 
    We provided a video in this post to show you how.
  </p>

  <h3>How much $MILK does a cow yeild?</h3>

  <p>
    A cow yields 4-60 $MILK/day/cow (according to google). 
    Amounts depends on what Crew you are in. 
  </p>

  <h3>Can $MILK amounts change?</h3>

  <p>
    $MILK amounts per crew (or trait!) can be changed at anytime 
    through a DAO quorum.
  </p>

  <h3>How to batch redeem $MILK from many cows?</h3>

  <p>
    We do have provisions on the contract to batch redeem $MILK 
    from many cows in one go. We decided to go for this one to 
    get people used the game as it progresses. We will schedule 
    batch milking at a later date for sure.
