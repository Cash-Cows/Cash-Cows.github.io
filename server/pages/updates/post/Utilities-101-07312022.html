  <h2>Utilities 101</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Cash Cows is a degen collection with over 14 utilities included.
    Here's what you need to know right now.
  </p>
  <h4>#1 How do rewards work?</h4>

  <p>
    When a cow is sold, a 10% creators fee is deducted 
    from the sale. This fee is sent to a smart contract and 
    allocated evenly to every Cow holder. You can redeem 
    rewards on our website/contract.
  </p>
  <h4>#2 Be careful listing your cow! </h4>
  <img alt="cash cows club rewards transfer" class="white-border" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FY3fgakVQAAUyPX?format=jpg&name=medium" />
  <p>
    If a cow is sold, the new owner will have the rights to 
    its unclaimed rewards. If you're going to sell it, list 
    it high so you won't be a sad cowboy later.
  </p>
  <h4>#3 Rarity isn't everything!</h4>
  <img alt="rarity versus rewards" class="white-border" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FY3fvpNUEAAxLJH?format=jpg&name=medium" />
  <p>
    When buying a cow during mint, buy a cow that hasn't 
    been purchased yet. ℹ️ Untraded cows most likely have 
    unclaimed rewards. 
  </p>
  <h4>#4 ZERO listing gas fees.</h4>

  <p>
    Enjoy ZERO gas fees when listing cows on OpenSea, 
    LooksRare and X2Y2. 👼 Looks like someone is watching 
    over you. 😇
  </p>
  <h4>#5 E-cow-nomics</h4>

  <p>
    Low Volume + Low Floor Price = Listed Cows Buying Cows = 
    Volume = Cows Happy 😀 <br />When in doubt, remember... 
    "it's a free mint"
  </p>
  <h4>#6 Fair Play</h4>
  <img alt="ethereum distribution to cow holders" class="white-border" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FY3gTAtVQAAmf9X?format=jpg&name=medium" />
  <p>
    The team earns by holding cows like everyone else. When 
    we win, we all win. 🎉 That's what we mean by sharing 
    the wealth. 💰
  </p>
  <h4>#7 Some cows need your help. </h4>
  <img alt="healing cows" class="white-border" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FY3gbFiVQAID4Pu?format=jpg&name=medium" />
  <p>
    ℹ️ If you get one of these poor bovines, you can nurse 
    it back to health and up its rarity along the way. ✨
  </p>
  <h4>#8 Volume = Rewards </h4>
  <img alt="rewards based on sales volume" class="white-border" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FY3gmn4UYAAshVr?format=jpg&name=medium" />
  <p>
    Rewards are sales volume-driven regardless of floor 
    price. 📈 High volume = High rewards. 🚨 Volume milestones 
    unlock new experiences in the project.
  </p>
  <h4>#9 Burning Cows</h4>
  <img alt="burning cows" class="white-border" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FY49qVZVsAA8u-1?format=jpg&name=medium" />
  <p>
    When you burn a cow you will get steak and a milk bonus.
    You need 4 steaks to free mint into the new collection.
    When cows are burnt, the rewards for everyone else 
    increases.
  </p>
  <h4>#10 What are Crews</h4>
  <img alt="cash cows club crewa" class="white-border" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FY5CbqjUEAA_P91?format=png&name=medium" />
  <p>
    There are 33 crews in Cash Cows. Some are popular, 
    some are rare. 🔎 Find your crew & collect them all 🧩
  </p>
  <h4>#11 Gallery</h4>

  <p>
    The gallery has instant rarity faster than any rarity 
    tool. ❣️ Use the gallery to ninja rare ones off the floor.
  </p>
  <h4>#12 Treasury</h4>
  <img alt="cash cows club treasury" class="white-border" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FY5RCBvUcAIdy_m?format=jpg&name=medium" />
  <p>
    You will be able to see how much is in the total 
    treasury and what rewards you can claim. Redeem all in

  <h4>#13 Redeem Rewards</h4>
  <img alt="how to redeem rewards" class="white-border" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FY5dzPOaUAAm1e7?format=jpg&name=medium" />
  <p>
    You can redeem rewards per cow. 🚨 Be careful though, 
    redeeming rewards may not unlock your cow's full 
    potential.
  </p>
  <h4>#14 Cow DAO (CAO)</h4>
  <img alt="Cow DAO" class="white-border" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FY5fRUyaUAA2IsC?format=jpg&name=medium" />
  <p>
    A gasless DAO for voting on things with the collection like:
    <br />
    <br />❓Adjusting Creator Fees
    <br />❓Reversing a Scam TX
    <br />❓Pausing Contract
    <br />❓Collection Strategy (like rn)
    <br />
    <br />You need 20 cows to initiate a proposal.
  </p>
  <h4>And More...</h4>
  <p>
    Cash Cows utilities were designed and developed with 
    decentralization and economics in mind. There are still 
    quite a number of utilities that will remain undocumented
    until the community hits particular milestones.
