  <h2>Loot is Now Live</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Welcome to Rodeo Drive❗ The shopping district where you can 
    buy loot that will be forever attached to your cows 
    <em>(soulbound)</em>. Loot is designed to increase the value 
    of your cow and will have a purpose when the community 
    reaches <strong>Boardwalk</strong>.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Loot can be purchased with either DOLLA or ETH where 
      available.
    </li>
    <li>
      Loot is soulbound to cows and each cow cannot have more 
      than 1 of the same item.
    </li>
    <li>
      When you sell your cow all the loot soul bound to that 
      cow will also be transfered to the new owner.
    </li>
    <li>Some loots are limited supply and some are unique.</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    🚨 Warning 🚨 
    <br />
    When you sell your cow, the loot is also automatically 
    transferred to the new owner.

    discounts depending on which crew they are in.
